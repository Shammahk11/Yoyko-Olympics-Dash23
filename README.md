# Yoyko-Olympics-Dash23

The products delivered are made for Yokio Fun Olympics organizing committee, so after modelling and building the prototype. The environment in which the committee will be using will have to be set up. This section will explain how the prototype will be delivered to the client.  
The client will be provided with three products first being the model which has been done by python using clustering algorithms, an interactive dashboard built using PowerBI and Web log files.

The first product to be delivered is Web log files. The log files will come as a CSV. For the client to be able to read it, their machines should have Microsoft Excel. The log files will be presented in a CSV format because the initial log files needed data cleaning and so providing the client with a clean dataset is better. A Microsoft account and subscription is therefore needed. During prototype production Microsoft Office 365 was used which had Excel subscription. 
The other deliverable was a model was build using python. Jupiter Notebook was used as the environment in which the model was built on. 
The dashboard was developed in Microsoft PowerBI. PowerBI was chosen mainly for its usability as it is easy to use. PowerBI has drop and drag functionality, so it is not complex to use therefore it is arguably error free. 

## Installation and Deployment

## Model 
It is always advisable to use the latest version of python in order to be able to use all the libraries available. Python has to be downloaded and installed into the host machine. To start building the model python 3.11.3 (which was the latest version at the start of  production) is downloaded and installed. Python is downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Jupiter Notebook also has to be installed into the host machine. This is the environment in which python will be run into for production. It is downloaded from https://jupyter.org/install. Python and Jupyter offers a documentation after downloading to help getting started. Once the packages are installed in the host machines, they are tested to see if they work. 

## Dashboard 
The dashboard was designed and developed on PowerBI. PowerBI has two versions which are PowerBI Online which is hosted on the web or PowerBI Desktop which is hosted on the local machine and has to downloaded and installed. The online version can be accessed at https://app.powerbi.com/home. PowerBI desktop is downloaded at https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore. After downloading you are then prompted to install the application and the instructions are clear and easy to understand. A Microsoft account is then needed to sign in to link it to the Office 365 subscription. There is a free version and paid version of PowerBI. The paid version consists of PowerBI pro and PowerBI premium.  

## HARDWARE & SOFTWARE USED
The product was developed on a laptop of HP ProBook model which has Intel core i5 processor with an 8GB memory, and Windows 10  with a 64-bit operating system.  The following are technical requirements for the products that will be delivered. 

## Hardware specifications:

CPU: Intel Core i5 or better 

Memory: 4GB but 8GB is recommended
  
## Display: 
Graphics

## Software specifications
Operating system: Windows 8.1 or better, macOS High Sierra or better.

Programming Language: Python 3.10

Documentation: Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel 

PowerBI Desktop(latest version)

## Network specification
Internet connection: Wi-Fi or ethernet.

## Procedures for the installation and deployment
1.	Install the hardware and software required in the production environment.
2.	Configure the model and dashboard in accordance with the production environment. 
3.	Deploy the model and dashboard to the production environment.
4.	Test if the products are working as they are supposed to be.

## Technical Aspects
## Dashboard
The dashboard should be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
The dashboard should provide different visualizations.
The dashboard should be error free.

## Model
The model should be trained from clean, large and unbiased dataset. 
The model should have a high accuracy level. 
The model should be scalable.

## Delivering the products
Once the development of the products and their evaluation, a preparation to move them from the developerâ€™s side to the one of the client begins. All the outputs from the project are added to a zip file that would have been created. The zip file is then send to the client by email and opened at that end.
